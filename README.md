# Twilio Unplugged: Coding Challenges

As Twilio continues to grow globally, we are committed to building an inclusive culture in our work places whether that be in the office or through a remote environment. We believe in providing everyone the same equitable opportunity. With that aspiration in mind, we created a new series called Twilio Unplugged for all aspiring talent to come build at Twilio.

One aspect of Twilio Unplugged is Coding Challenges, an interactive online mock coding interview that walks viewers through how to tackle a typical interview question they could expect when interviewing with Twilio. This repo contains functioning code solutions to each coding challenge (structured by Twilio Unplugged episode).

Feel free to add to the repo by solving the problem in a different programming language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This repo was created with [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), C#, and [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). If you're planning to contribute a solution to the repo in a different programming language, you can use your preferred code editor (or IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc. 

### Running the .NET Repo

To get the C# repo running,
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the folder in your preferred code editor - we're using Visual Studio Code for these instructions
3. In a terminal, change to the csharp code directory and build the console application by typing:

```
cd 'episode 1/csharp/app'
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

This should change the terminal to the directory of the C# project, build the console application, and then run it in the terminal.
